## MyWonder cloud-based computing platform  

# Three watses in this project  
Extra-storage: Storing unnecessary files on the cloud. Customer will sometimes forget what they have stored in the system and create subplicate files. These duplicated files take up huge space and reduce speed for other applications.  

Over-specification: Redundant terminology and functionalities in the user interface. "test visualization" and "test content" seems to be in the same functionality. Such redundency will cause confusion in user experience.  

Product defects: Cloud-based platform system failure and excessive internet overhead will affect the performance of our product.
